\begin{frame}{Dark Matter}
Over time different hypotheses have been proposed to explain DM physical nature$^1$. One of the most attractive is Weakly Interacting Massive Particle (WIMP) models that remain as a strong possibility for understanding DM.

\subsection{The WIMP paradigm}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{}
Assuming there exist interactions between a cosmologically stable particle $\chi$-the (generic) DM with Standard Model (SM) particles, sizable enough that for a high enough temperature $T$ the DM is in thermal equilibrium with the primordial thermal bath, the cosmological evolution of the DM particle can be traced through the following Boltzmann equation\footcite{Arcadi2017}:
\[
\frac{dn_{\chi}}{dt}+3H(T)n_{\chi}=-\left\langle \sigma v \right\rangle \left(n^2_{\chi}-n^2_{\chi,eq}\right)
\]
describing the DM number density $n_{\chi}$ in turn defined as:

\[
n_{\chi}(T)=\int\frac{d^3p}{(2\pi)^2}f_{\chi}(p,T)
\]

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{}

As the Universe expands, the scale factor increases and the temperature decreases. Assuming that $\chi$ continues to be in thermal equilibrium, eventually the temperature drops below the DM mass, and the annihilation rate for DM particles, which depends linearly on the number equilibrium density $n_{\chi,eq}$, enters the so-called “Boltzmann-tail”: 
\[
n_{\chi,eq}\propto\exp(-m_{\chi}/T)
\]; 
the annihilation rate then eventually fall below the Universe expansion rate, $H(T)$ (a power-law in temperature, $\propto T^2$ in the radiation-dominated universe), leading to the thermal freeze-out of this “cold” relic. Thereafter, the DM comoving number density $Y_{\chi}=\frac{n_{\chi}}{s}$ \footnote{text} is approximately constant.
